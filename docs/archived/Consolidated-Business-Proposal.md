# Underground Utility Detection Platform
## Consolidated Business Proposal

---

## Executive Summary

**The Opportunity**: Underground utility strikes cost £2.4B annually in the UK alone, with each incident averaging £60K-£1M in total damages. Current PAS 128 compliance reporting takes 6-8 hours of manual work per project.

**Our Solution**: First AI-native platform that generates PAS 128-compliant reports in 10 minutes (vs 8 hours), reduces utility strikes by 60%, and provides predictive risk assessment using RAG technology and multi-source data fusion.

**Market Size**: £280M UK market growing at 9.1% CAGR, expanding to £600M by 2033. Clear path to £10M ARR within 36 months.

**Investment Ask**: £500K pre-seed to deliver MVP in 8 weeks with 3 lighthouse customers.

## Problem Analysis

### The Utility Strike Crisis

**Quantified Impact**:
- **UK Annual Strikes**: 15,000+ incidents
- **Average Cost per Strike**: £60K-£1M total cost
- **Total UK Economic Impact**: £2.4B annually
- **Fatalities**: 12-15 per year in UK
- **Rising Enforcement**: 40% YoY increase in HSE prosecutions

**Root Causes**:
1. **Inaccurate Records** (45% of strikes)
   - Utility maps 5-30 years outdated
   - 30-50% positional accuracy
   - Missing depth information

2. **Detection Failures** (35% of strikes)
   - GPR interpretation requires 5+ years experience
   - Plastic pipes invisible to EMI
   - Multiple utilities in congestion zones

3. **Human Error** (20% of strikes)
   - Misreading of detection equipment
   - Incorrect marking on ground
   - Time pressure leading to shortcuts

### Current Workflow Inefficiencies

**Manual PAS 128 Reporting Process (8 hours total)**:
1. Data Collection (2 hours) - Gather GPR/EMI files, utility records, site photos
2. Data Analysis (3 hours) - Interpret GPR radargrams, correlate sources, identify conflicts
3. Report Writing (2 hours) - Write narratives, assign quality levels, add citations
4. Quality Check (1 hour) - Review compliance, verify accuracy, format deliverables

**Financial Impact**:
- Surveyor Cost: £60-80/hour
- Report Cost: £480-640 in labor
- Project Delays: 2-3 days for report delivery
- Rework Rate: 25-40% require revisions
